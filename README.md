### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Luke Nava - an experienced digital marketer, currently pursuing a new, data-oriented career direction and completing a Data Science Bootcamp with HyperionDev.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and its many libraries, Jupyter Notebook and SQLite, and applying them to real-world projects through my bootcamp and for personal interest. I'll be adding them to repositories here.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the next stage of my learning - what languages and tools I should develop next?

ğŸ’¬ You can ask me about marketing metrics. I love measuring marketing effectiveness and ROI, and I'm happy to share tips.

ğŸ“« You can reach me via [email](mailto:navaluke@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukenava/).

ğŸ˜„ My pronouns are He/Him.

ğŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by.
